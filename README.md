- 👋 Hi, I’m @Crynger
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, more specific - Pentesting -, learning how to handle security and data traffic on a smartphone and many more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some python on Cisco Networking Academy and I am enrolled in a Py course on Coursera 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is related to these subjects and fields that are similar. Also I am a CFD Engineer, with some CAE background, working only in ANSA.
     If you need some help with ANSA, just let me know.
- 📫 How to reach me -> e-mail: steficena@gmail.com. I know, I know, cringe email address.
